## Overview

Replace the unnecessary walk to the next supermarket by a new shoppinglist in entel. If you are going to the store, help others close to you by accepting their shopping list and bring them the products they need!

_entel_ is a modern web app that is built with [Blitz.js](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz), a full-stack React framework, made to boost productivity.
A hosted version can be found at [**entel.me**](https://www.entel.me/)
